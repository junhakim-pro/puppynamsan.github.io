                    <h2>Getting Started: From Airport to City Center</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Your journey begins at Incheon International Airport (ICN). You have two great train options to get into Seoul:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AREX Express Train:</strong> The fastest way. It runs non-stop from Incheon to Seoul Station in about 45 minutes. Perfect if you're staying near the city center.</li>
                    <li><strong>AREX All-Stop Train:</strong> A bit slower (about 60 minutes) as it makes several stops, but it connects directly to other subway lines, which might be more convenient depending on your destination.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="p-4 bg-orange-50 border border-orange-200 rounded-lg mt-6">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-orange-800">Must-Do: Get a T-money Card</h3>
                    <p class="text-orange-700">Before you even get on the train, buy a <strong>T-money card</strong>. This is your rechargeable transportation card. You can buy and top it up at any convenience store (like 7-Eleven, GS25) or at the ticket vending machines inside every subway station. You simply tap the card on the reader when you enter and exit the gates. It's cheaper than single-use tickets and works on buses too!</p>

                    <h2>Navigation: Your Digital Compass</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The Seoul subway map looks like a colorful bowl of spaghetti, but don't worry! Technology is your best friend here. Download one of these essential apps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Naver Map (ÎÑ§Ïù¥Î≤Ñ ÏßÄÎèÑ):</strong> The most popular and accurate map service in Korea. It provides real-time train tracking, tells you which car to board for the fastest transfer, and calculates the best route. It's available in English.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kakao Maps (Ïπ¥Ïπ¥Ïò§Îßµ):</strong> Another excellent choice with similar features to Naver Map.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These apps will be your lifeline. Just enter your destination, and they'll handle the rest.</p>

                    <h2>Riding the Subway: The Basics</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Navigating the stations is surprisingly easy. Everything is color-coded and signed in English.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Follow the Colors and Numbers:</strong> Each line has a unique color and number (e.g., Line 2 is the green circle line). Signs on the walls and floors will guide you to your platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check Your Direction:</strong> Before going down to the platform, check the signs that list the major stations in each direction. Your map app will tell you the name of the final station in your direction of travel (e.g., "Towards Gangnam").</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfers are Easy:</strong> To transfer, just follow the "Transfer to Line X" signs. The apps will even tell you how long the walk will be. Tap out and tap back in only when the signs explicitly tell you to.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use the free Wi-Fi:</strong> Most subway cars have free Wi-Fi available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mind the designated seating:</strong> There are seats reserved for the elderly, pregnant women, and disabled passengers at the ends of each car. Avoid using them unless you need to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stand clear of the doors:</strong> People will rush in and out, so it's best to stand to the side while waiting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay quiet:</strong> It's considered polite to keep conversations low and avoid talking on the phone while on the train.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay attention to the last train:</strong> Service usually ends around midnight. Your app will tell you the last train time for your route.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That's it! With your T-money card and a good map app, you're ready to conquer the Seoul subway. Enjoy the efficiency, the cleanliness, and the incredible access it gives you to this amazing city. Happy travels!</p>
